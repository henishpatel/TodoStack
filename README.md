Change priorities to your wish.
Filter by priority of your tasks and finish off your utmost importants.
There's a change in your task schedule, unlock it, edit it and get it locked.
Done with your task. Pheww!! Get it throwed in the trash bin by drag/drop feature.
Ohh god!! closed the site by accident, don't worry, your tasks are saved in local storage. Just reopen the site.
